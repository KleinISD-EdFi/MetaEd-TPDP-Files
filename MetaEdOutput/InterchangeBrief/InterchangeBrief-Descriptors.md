# Descriptors Interchange

# Overview

Descriptors provide states, districts, vendors, and other users of the Ed-Fi solution with the flexibility to use their own enumerations and code sets without modifying the Ed-Fi core schema.

The Descriptor interchange is used to describe metadata about the descriptors and their structure. It is used to define enumeration vocabularies that are not "fixed" within the XML schema, but are loaded in XML files and linked to their source.



Like all standard Ed-Fi interchanges, this schema references the Ed-Fi Core XSD and can be extended using the Ed-Fi Extensions Framework. See the [Ed-Fi Data Standard - Developers' Guide] for more information.


# Use Cases

The Descriptors Interchange can be used to:  

1. Exchange state, district, or vendor code sets in a way that Ed-Fi technology implementations can understand the semantics
2. Exchange code or enumeration values that change over time, but where longitudinal analysis is still important
